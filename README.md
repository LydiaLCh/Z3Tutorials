# Using Z3 to solve logical and biological problems!

## Introduction

How do write timetable my day so that I meet everyone and avoid other peoples clashes? How do I get
4 litres of water exactly when I only have a 3 litre jug and a 5 litre jug? Can this Suduko puzzle 
even get solved? 

Each of these questions can arise in different ways for most people, sometimes in life or death 
situations if you are John McClane. These problems can be fun to solve, but 

### Getting started (tools and editors)

## Timeless models

Here we give some examples of how to encode different constraints in Z3 to solve problems where we
are only interested in systems where elements don't change in time.

### Which number is bigger?

### Liars paradox

### Suduko solver

### Einsteins Riddle

## Ordering and simulations (bounded model checking)

### Die Hard with a Vengance

## Biological systems
